## Data-Analysis-Projects-Portfolio
This repository showcases my data analysis project, featuring tasks like data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization.

This research dataset contains 157,630 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and catalogued in their database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum. Some of these records have incomplete information and are noted as “not Curator Approved.”

### Analysis
- How modern are the artworks at the Museum?
- Which artists are featured the most?
- Are there any trends in the dates of acquisition?
- What types of artwork are most common?

### Processes
- Removed duplicates to keep the data clean.
- Handled missing values by filling or removing them.
- Standardized dates for consistency.
- Grouped data by year/quarter to spot trends.
- Removed outliers that didn’t fit the pattern.
- Categorized artwork types for clarity.
- Sorted data by year/acquisitions for easy analysis.
- Calculated fields like averages for deeper insights.
- Formatted and validated data for readability.
- Checked for errors to ensure consistency.
